## About this Project
The [Snapmaker 2.0, 3-in-1]() printer is available at the iSTEMLabsAfrica Innovation Center. We want customers to visit a specific URL at which they can do the following:

* Order prints from available designs listed on our online shop.
* Request custom design work to be done
* Upload their own designs for subsequent printing

Prints are then produced in 3D (in plastic), Laser (on surfaces like metal, wood, glass) or as Computer Numerically Computed (C.N.C) carvings (wood, glass, metal), packaged and shipped to the customer.
